- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZongZheJiang! I am currently enrolled in the Renaissance Engineering Programme offered by Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to make full use of programming to create products, physical or digital, that can provide utility to users!
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning Python, Typescript, C# and more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this webpage to learn more about programming! Even though I may not have much experience if any, I can make up for my proactiveness and self-discipline!
